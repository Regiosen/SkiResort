# SkiResort
This is a .net console application. 
It reads a file in the SkiResort/SkiLodge/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/ that contains the description of a matrix.
Once the matrix is read it finds the longest "downward path" that can be gotten by moving up, down, left or right from an int in the matrix.
In order to run the program properly one must properly indicate the name of the file to be read. (An image called "ArgumentExample" is attached showing the properties of the project in which this argument is set).
There is also a video attached demonstrating how the application works. It is called "Demo"
